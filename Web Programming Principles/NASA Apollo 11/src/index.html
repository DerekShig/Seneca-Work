        On <strong>July 16, 1969</strong>,
        <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> launched the
        Columbia spacecraft into space with one purpose, to be the first to put man on the Moon. On
        board the spacecraft was Neil Armstrong, Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin and Michael Collins. The
        spacecraft consisted of 3 main modules: the command module names Columbia, a service module
        and the lunar module Eagle. To launch them into space, the modules were connected to the
        Saturn V rocket. At 111 meters tall and 6.2 million pounds, the rocket would generate over
        34.5 million newtons of thrust at launch, carrying the 3 astronauts to their destination.

        At 9:32am, being broadcasted to all mankind, the spaceship took off from the Kennedy Space
        Center. Columbia spent approximately 2 hours and 33 minutes in Earth’s orbit before the
        S-IVB engine was ignited again for its journey to the moon. They spent 76 hours in space,
        travelling over 240,000 miles until they reached lunar orbit. The following day at 1:46pm,
        the lunar module named Eagle separated from the command module and at 4:17pm the spacecraft
        made contact with the Moon. Michael Collins would remain in Columbia, serving as a
        communications link for the two astronauts and also photographed the surrounding landscape.

        At 10:39pm, the hatch of the Columbia spacecraft was opened and the first steps were taken
        on the moon by Neil Armstrong. After both astronauts were on the surface, they conducted
        scheduled tasks such as collecting over 50 pounds of lunar rock and soil, deploying a sheet
        of foil to catch solar-wind particles and took photographs of the landscape and of Earth,
        now almost 400,000 km behind them.

        On July 21 at 1:11am, after being on the lunar surface for over 21 hours, Armstrong and
        Aldrin climbed back into the lunar module and closed the hatch and slept for the night.
        Before their departure they left some items such as the American flag planted in the lunar
        surface. Among the items was a plaque that read:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <em
          >&lsquo;Here men from the planet Earth first set foot on the moon—July 1969 A.D.—We came
          in peace for all mankind.&rsquo;</em
        >
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        At 1:54pm the next day, the Eagle module began its ascent back to the command module where
        Collins lay wait. At 5:35pm they docked and rejoin the command module and jettisoned the
        Eagle module, where it would crash into the lunar surface months later. At 12:56am on Jul
        21, Apollo 11 began its journey back to Earth. On July 24, it landed in the Pacific Ocean
        after a total mission time of around 8 days.

        The Apollo 11 mission is considered one of the most important accomplishments by mankind, as
        it gave hope and inspiration to millions of people watching as the world was on the brink of
        a nuclear war. Mankind united in awe as humans make the first steps in intergalactic space
        travel.
