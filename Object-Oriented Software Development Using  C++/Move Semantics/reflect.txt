In this workshop I learned how to use the chrono library to time the 
length of function execution times. I think this would be something 
really useful in a real world setting since you can test if refracturing 
code can make it run more efficiently. The main topic I learned in the 
workshop is move semantics. In my implementation, I used copy 
constructor and assignment operator. Because the copy has to heap 
allocate memory, the execution time is greater. The move constructor 
I used is very similar, except that it takes a rvalue reference and 
instead of copying the entire object and creating new memory, it 
instead simply takes the pointer reference of the copy object and 
set the copy object to null. 

In essence it is taking the resources from the object, and since the 
copy object is a rvalue, it will go out of scope. When timing the move 
functions, it is clear that It runs much faster because it does not have 
to allocate new memory.
